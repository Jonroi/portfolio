I started in this open-source project as an intern, but my contributions quickly led to a promotion to lead programmer. Now, I manage a team of over 10 diverse members, including volunteer developers, graphic designers, and students, all working together to maintain and expand the project.

The project itself is based on a mobile game, and our team focuses on creating web pages to support the game’s community—such as clan management tools, character information, and resources that deepen players’ understanding of the game’s world.

One of our organization’s primary goals is to bring this game into schools as an educational tool. We aim to show students how art, programming, and design come together in game development, highlighting how each contributor—whether a graphic artist, designer, or coder—plays a vital role in bringing a game to life. By integrating the project into classrooms, we hope to inspire students in game art, programming, and teamwork, demonstrating how open-source projects can bring people together across different skill sets and backgrounds.
